        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class="left btmspace-50 font-big">
        <p>Much of the worldâ€™s response to Covid-19 has been in terms of lockdowns, which have been hugely damaging by
          themselves, especially to the poor and the working class. But the treatment of children in the Covid response
          has been <b>unconscionable</b>. We as parents, teachers, educationists, doctors, epidemiologists,
          paediatricians, other professionals, and also as concerned citizens, call for an <b>immediate end to ongoing
            disproportionate and hugely harmful disruptions to children's lives</b>.</p>
        <p>The risk of Covid-19 to children is miniscule, far lesser than other risks we accept as a normal part of
          life. Thus the disruptions to children's lives are of no benefit to them and are hugely harmful. Each of us
          adults has enjoyed a normal childhood of learning, play, socialization, arts and music, and sports. Each child
          today deserves the same.</p>
        <p>We therefore call for <b>immediate resumption of all schools and related activities for all kids</b>. We also
          call for:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>No disruptive social distancing for kids:</b> This disruption is no longer acceptable, is of no benefit
            for children, and is hugely harmful to their mental and social well-being, and all-round development.</li>
          <li><b>No emergency-use jabs for kids:</b> Children have not had a Covid emergency anywhere in the world;
            therefore, the use of emergency use medical intervention is unacceptable. Kids should not be given jabs
            whose long-term effects are clearly unknown.</li>
          <li><b>No asymptomatic Covid testing for kids:</b> "Asymptomatic illness" is an oxymoron. Disruptions to
            schools or other kids' activities based on such testing are no longer acceptable.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The above measures are still being followed, with the stated goal of virus eradication or Zero-Covid. Chasing
          Zero-Covid is not only an unachievable scientific fantasy, but it is also hugely harmful to kids. This harm
          must stop immediately. We owe a normal, healthy, fear-free, anxiety-free environment to kids.</p>
